The Flask-WTF extension makes working with web forms a much more
pleasant experience. This extension is a Flask integration wrapper around
the framework-agnostic WTForms package.

By default, Flask-WTF protects all forms against Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) attacks. A CSRF attack occurs when a malicious website
sends requests to a different website on which the victim is logged in.

The app.config dictionary is a general-purpose place to store
configuration variables used by the framework, the extensions, or the
application itself. Configuration values can be added to the app.config
object using standard dictionary syntax. The configuration object also has
methods to import configuration values from files or the environment.

The SECRET_KEY configuration variable is used as a general-purpose
encryption key by Flask and several third-party extensions. As its name
implies, the strength of the encryption depends on the value of this variable
being secret. Pick a different secret key in each application that you build
and make sure that this string is not known by anyone.

NOTE
For added security, the secret key should be stored in an environment variable instead of
being embedded in the code.
Use {{wtf.quick_form(form)}} to quick use of formulary

Table 4-2. WTForms validators

Validator                            Description
Email                                Validates an email address
EqualTo                              Compares the values of two fields; useful when requesting a password to
                                     be entered twice for confirmation
IPAddress                            Validates an IPv4 network address
Length                               Validates the length of the string entered
NumberRange                          Validates that the value entered is within a numeric range
Optional                             Allows empty input on the field, skipping additional validators
Required                             Validates that the field contains data
Regexp                               Validates the input against a regular expression
URL                                  Validates a URL
AnyOf                                Validates that the input is one of a list of possible values
NoneOf                               Validates that the input is none of a list of possible values

Redirects and User Sessions

NOTE
By default, user sessions are stored in client-side cookies that are cryptographically
signed using the configured SECRET_KEY. Any tampering with the cookie content would
render the signature invalid, thus invalidating the session.

Message Flashing

Use the methods flash() and on the template use get_flashed_messages(), that return a list of messages
